<p> The purpose of this exercise was to drive more efficient execution of existing code by reworking and streamlineing the coursework from Module 2.<p/>

## Results<br>
<p>Code did not execute, resuts not available for this exercise.  Since the asynchronous code worked and I was unabe to debug this version, the previous version was quicker!<p/>

## Summary<p/>
Advantages of refactoring the code:<br>
-Adaptabiity to add data with minimal future refactoring<br>
-Concise code that makes sense logically<br>
-Efficient structure<br>
Disadvantages of refactoring the code:<br>
-I MESSED IT UP<br>
